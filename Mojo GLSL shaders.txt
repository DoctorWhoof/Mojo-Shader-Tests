If you just want to learn about GLSL without a focus on Mojo, I recommend this:

************************************************** Mojo shaders **************************************************

"Varying"

	Varying properties are always defined in the shader itself, and can be shared between fragment and vertex shaders.
	They always start with "v_" in mojo shaders.

"Attributes" are user-defined vertex attributes passed by Mojo. Examples:
	a_Position
	a_TexCoord0
	a_TexCoord1
	a_Color
	a_Normal
	a_Tangent
	a_Weights
	a_Bones

"Uniforms" are passed by different Mojo classes.
	Those preceded by "r_" seem to be set by the Renderer. Examples:
		r_AmbientLight
		r_BufferCoordScale
		r_DepthBuffer
		r_DepthFar
		r_DepthNear
		r_LightViewMatrix
		r_LightRange
		r_LightColor
		r_GBufferScale
		r_GBuffer0
		r_GBuffer1
		r_ModelViewMatrix
		r_ModelViewProjectionMatrix
		r_ViewportOrigin
		r_ViewportSize
		r_ViewportClip
		r_ShadowCSMTexture
		r_ShadowCSMSplits
		r_ShadowMatrix0
		r_ShadowMatrix1
		r_ShadowMatrix2
		r_ShadowMatrix3
		etc.

	Those preceded by "m_" seem to be set by the material or post-effect. Examples:
		m_Color
		m_Near
		m_Far
		m_ImageColor
		m_ImageTexture0
		m_LightDepth
		m_SourceTexture
		m_SourceTextureSize
		m_SourceTextureScale
		etc.
